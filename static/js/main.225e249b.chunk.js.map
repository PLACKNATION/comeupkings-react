You ever wake up one morning for a sneaker release and then right\n            when you about to checkout *boom* SOLD OUT? I have, its ridiculous how unfair\n            your chances of getting shoes for retail can be nowadays. When the J1 Mochas came\n            out back in late in October I really had my hopes up woke up thinking I was going to\n            win, that ship sailed real quick…I brought this issue to a very close friend of mine \"Mr.Kihng\". He told\n            me “Lets make a tool that can help everyday people beat the bots and resellers”.\n            </h1>\n          </div>\n\n          \n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"container-2\">\n        <div className=\"text-container-2\">\n          <h1>\n            Today people are so busy with\n            work, travel and life be taking up most of your time.

Not only that but the\n            market is flooded with “Bots” and “Resellers” and they be charging a fortune for\n            sneakers that shouldn’t even be that expensive. Like bro I shouldn’t have to pay\n            $500 for a pair of shoes that cost only $170 retail.\n          </h1>\n          </div>\n\n          <div className=\"happylogo\">\n            <img src={happy} className=\"happy-logo-motion\" alt=\"happy\" />\n          </div>\n        \n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"container-3\">\n            <div className=\"templogo1\">\n              <img src={logo} className=\"logo-motion\" alt=\"logo\" />\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"text-container-3\">\n              <h2>What we as a company would like to offer is an opportunity for sneaker\n              enthusiasts all over the country to have a chance of getting the shoe that they desire \n              for retail through our EXCLUSIVE website.
